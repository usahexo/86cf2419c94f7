If your cat isn't moving around very much and seems to be sleeping a lot, it's possible that he or she is bored. This can be dangerous, as boredom can lead to weight gain and other health problems in cats.\n\nThere are a few things you can do to help keep your cat entertained. One great way to keep cats amused is with toys. There are many different kinds of toys available for cats, so find one or two that your cat seems to enjoy playing with.
